David Mamane, MSc Student at Imperial College London in *Environmental Data Science and machine learning*. 
My interest lies especially in Deep Learning. 
This repository has been created to present my portfolios of projects as of January 2025. The last one includes a project regarding storm prediction in a chaotic environment.

# My projects

## Chaotic storm predictions

Due to its chaotic nature, predicting storms can be often difficult. This project aimed to assess this inherent difficulty as with time the prediction will always get worse, as well as how different types remote sensing images can lead to different output. The type of images are the following: Vertically Integrated Liquid (VIL), Visible Satellite Imagery (VIS), Infrared 6.9um and Thermal Infrared. D
- Data : one csv file - event.csv, that contains lightning informations for multiple 'events'. One event is 3 hours. As well as an h5py file with for each event 36 frames. (1 frame every 5 minutes). 
  
## Flood Risk Prediction and Visualization Tool

Flooding poses significant risks to the UK, exacerbated by climate change. This project aimsto develop a Python-based tool for classifying flood risk, estimating house prices, and
visualizing rainfall and river data. The tool provides rapid, data-driven assessments of flood
risk using machine learning and integrates historical, geographic, and real-time
environmental data. The project was completed in a demanding five-day period. Data is scattered.

## MRI Scans for brain analysis

The project aimed to address the challenge of reconstructing missing regions in MRI scans, a critical issue in medical imaging where time and cost constraints often result in incomplete scans. Develop a simple but efficient U-Net that could accurately restore corrupted 64x64 MRI images.
